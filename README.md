# Shortest path problem with weighted A* algorithm

In graph theory, the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized. For a directed graph with 100 nodes,  the x- and y-coordinate of the nodes and the distance between each pair of nodes.

Implement a weighted A* search (Graph Search implementation) in Python to find the shortest path from a starting to an ending node.

enter three parameters as the input:
1. starting node index,
2. ending node index,
3. the weight parameter of the weighted A* search.

In the end, the algorithm should return the followings:

1. a message indicating “There is no path”, in case your algorithms couldn’t find any path from the starting node to the ending node.
2. the cost of the obtained path, in case there is a path,
3. the sequence of the nodes on the obtained path, in case there is a path,
4. the total number of nodes generated within the search process.
